# Recipe Seeker

Recipe Seeker is a React-based web application for browsing and viewing recipes. Users can search for recipes, view detailed instructions, ingredients, and watch related cooking videos.

The app also has a randomizer to help a user choose a recipe without having to browse all the available choices.

The app was first created as part of my thesis to practice modern web development using React and Tailwind.

NOTE! This is version 2 of the app. Original thesis version can be found here: https://github.com/AlinaLokkinen/recipeseeker.

## Features

- **Browse Recipes:** Search and view recipes fetched from an external API.
- **Detailed View:** See recipe name, category, image, ingredients, and instructions.
- **Video Instructions:** If available, watch cooking instructions on YouTube.
- **Random recipes:** Have the app choose a recipe for you, based on your choice of category.
- **Responsive UI:** Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern look.
